ABOUT:
    The command line calculator (CLC) is a high-capacity calculator designed to run
    the UNIX or MS-DOS command line. It supports variables, matricies, functions,
    strings, booleans, data file I/O, running and creating programs, and saving
    ASCII records of the calculator's output. It is designed to interface with the
    scientific computing library KPack. Specifically, the KPack data types and
    data files can be read, modified, and written by CLC.
