# Command-Line-Calculator
An advanced calculator that runs in the command line

Have you ever been using you command line, stumbled across some calculation you needed to do, then wish you could just
type it right into the command line? Well now you can!

The command line calculator (CLC) is a command line program (gee, imagine that), that is a calculator (surprise!), however it has
some very nice features that make it a little more than your average calculator. It can handle floating point operations, matrix operations,
boolean operations (what?), and even operations on strings (why?). The rationale behind this is two-fold.

  1. CLC is designed to be a front end of sorts for the scientific computing library KPack. CLC allows the user to view, read, modify,
    and write the KV files used by KPack. This symbiotic relationship between CLC and KPack makes them both more useful and powerful tools.
  2. Octave/MATLAB is really annoying to use (at least from the perspective of a C/C++/Java/etc/actual programming language programmer who
    is required to use MATLAB/Octave frequently for academic/professional applications) and expensive! CLC provides a nice, C-style syntax 
    calculator that can perform many duties that would otherwise be prone to gobbling up by Octave/MATLAB (or maybe Python which isn't evil
    but still, C/C++/Java is so nice!)
    
Still not convinved? Here are some delicious features to sell your calculator palate (which is now a thing) on CLC hopefully!
  1. Supports user defined functions
  2. Easily configurable startup options
  3. Predefined variables saved at startup (Pi anyone?), and are easily user configurable (see #2 in case you forgot super quickly).
  4. Can execute programs!
  5. Fully open-source, well commented, neat, dare I say poetic (except poetry is dumb, so no) code is easy to modify should you so desire.
  6. Makes a record of your calculations so you can save your work as a text file if/when you come up with a Grand Unified Field Theory!
  7. There is a dinosaur right below this line, and it may or may not have layed an egg (on easter, wink wink nod nod) in CLC...
