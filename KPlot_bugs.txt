-------------- WORKS IN PROGRESS -----------

as of 24.12.2017: Working in kgraphics - the problem is eliminating traces extending outside the graph area. The origional idea was to geometricly trim the chunks of trace exiting the area, which I am currently working on. I am writing a new function 'trim_ktrace' which trims a ktrace to exist only within a region. That is still a fine idea, but the question is if you want to graph one data set with lines but you want a gap to exist also, you would need two traces. I think thats fine, I think its uncommon to need and I think that it would be easy enough to just use two traces or points.

Fixing kp2 running in main : Color wasn't changing (other settings weren't working either). I found the issue - the addTrace method being used is old and doesn't work correctly - you need to update it (it adds a trace to an object that isn't in the mainWindow).

----------- BUGS --------------

//Numeric Labels can appear outside the graph

If plot exceeds graph bounds, its exiting the graph!

Font is fuzzy

Draw a box outside the graph area so that thick lines don't poke out.

label and numeral locations

Tesselation is wrong!{
	KMatrix kmX("0, 2, 6, 2, 0, -2, -6, -2, 0");
    KMatrix kmY("6, 2, 0, -2, -6, -2, 0, 2, 6");
    KPlot kp2("Trace1", kmX, kmY);
//    kp.setBounds(-5, 5, -5, 5);
    kp2.setBounds(-10, 10, -10, 10);
    if (!kp2.setTraceColor("Trace1", sf::Color::Red));
}
