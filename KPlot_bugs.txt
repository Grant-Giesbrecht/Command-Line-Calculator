-------------- WORKS IN PROGRESS -----------

Fixing kp2 running in main : Color wasn't changing (other settings weren't working either). I found the issue - the addTrace method being used is old and doesn't work correctly - you need to update it (it adds a trace to an object that isn't in the mainWindow).

----------- BUGS --------------

Numeric Labels can appear outside the graph

If plot exceeds graph bounds, its exiting the graph!

Font is fuzzy
