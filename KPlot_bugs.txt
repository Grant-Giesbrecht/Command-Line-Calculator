-------------- WORKS IN PROGRESS -----------

as of 24.12.2017: Working in kgraphics - the problem is eliminating traces extending outside the graph area. The origional idea was to geometricly trim the chunks of trace exiting the area, which I am currently working on. I am writing a new function 'trim_ktrace' which trims a ktrace to exist only within a region. That is still a fine idea, but the question is if you want to graph one data set with lines but you want a gap to exist also, you would need two traces. I think thats fine, I think its uncommon to need and I think that it would be easy enough to just use two traces or points.

Fixing kp2 running in main : Color wasn't changing (other settings weren't working either). I found the issue - the addTrace method being used is old and doesn't work correctly - you need to update it (it adds a trace to an object that isn't in the mainWindow).

----------- BUGS --------------

//Numeric Labels can appear outside the graph

If plot exceeds graph bounds, its exiting the graph!

Font is fuzzy

Draw a box outside the graph area so that thick lines don't poke out.

label and numeral locations

Tesselation is wrong!{
	KMatrix kmX("0, 2, 6, 2, 0, -2, -6, -2, 0");
    KMatrix kmY("6, 2, 0, -2, -6, -2, 0, 2, 6");
    KPlot kp2("Trace1", kmX, kmY);
//    kp.setBounds(-5, 5, -5, 5);
    kp2.setBounds(-10, 10, -10, 10);
    if (!kp2.setTraceColor("Trace1", sf::Color::Red));
}

Allow grid & axis color to be changed. Make default much lighter. Allow small && || large grid to be turned on and off.



--------- IMPLEMENT -----------

Design choices:
	- Have a 'plot()' function, where you can give it just vectors or arrays or a KMatrix. Keep it simple for those who don't care (like honeybadger).
	- Have all style and setting parameters (bounds, grids, colors, etc) saved to structs so that they can be passed around plot easily and allow them to be saved to a standardized KV1 so that they can be read, loaded, saved, etc.

Needs to accept arrays as input!

Add thick border to edge of graph

Add nub/tick marks to axes or edge of graph if origin out of frame

Dual axes, maybe quadruple

Log axes

Allow lines(traces) thinner than '1'.

Allow drawing lines, circles, text, etc on graph

Automatic axes and ticks

Add a wait/timer command to stdutil (for, among other things, timing KPlot animations).

Add plenty of KPlot default colors

save as KV1P file

---------- LONG TERM IMPLEMENT -----------

Save as file

Implement toolbar / buttons

Dual axes (L & R)

Mobile legend

Show label at end or grid line if no numeric ticks

----------------- TO DEFEAT MATLAB ----------------

Need to allow thinner lines (and more options - thick lines are a bane).

Need better standardization - fully support vectors and arrays at every step of the way - need 1D KMatrix style object

Need convenience functions:
	- initialize vector, array, matrix to given size, spacing, etc.
	- Evaluate CLC expression at given resolution through number of points
	- Evaluate function (via fn pointer) over entire matrix, array, vector
	- print vector, matrix, etc
	- 

Need brief and to the point summary of the best functions, etc.

Need web resource for help with CLC, KPack, KPlot, etc.

KMatrix needs to be better

I need to avoid as much as possible forcing people to use KMatrix. Make it desirable

speed of vector vs array vs matrix (access and allocation)

easy imaginary numbers

------------------ NAILS IN THE COFFIN OF MATLAB -----------

Memory limitations in MATLAB (esp. 32bit) are extreme and LIMITING, especially given availability of memory nowadays. C++ can even access HDD. GTFO CLOWN
