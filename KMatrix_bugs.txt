problems with KMatrix as of 11.10.2017:

?still? KMAtrix - ask for row oob and will cause error!

Does not load matricies!

//KMatrix print() has endl;

——————— IMPLEMENT ———————

- array to KMatrix

- unify print & to_string so both return same format

- operator+=(double) possible?

- imaginary numbers?
