problems with CLC as of 9.5.2017:

	//Finish fixing strings

Update KV1 to new specs

PRCD does not print startup program commands.

	//Make functions work

	//(-) spacing incorrect #-# won’t work, problem when spacing variables too
	//SVRCD saves to ‘record.rcd’ regardless of what user requests

	//Header from load variable file transported to saved KV files

	//Loads variables twice!

	//1e400 thinks its a variable!

	//Easter eggs can double load variables

Precision = 5e5

KMAtrix - ask for row oob and will cause error!

KMatrix print() has endl;

	// Can not use var names in matrix

	// Matrix with string elements crashes

	// Variables are all just 0

To prevent variables from all being zero, changed internal precision to 400. Now all variables are 400 characters long. Make this more efficient.

PRCD will not use scientific notation!

Matrix out will not print in scientific notation

Matrix will not accept small (plank's) numbers. //I think the Matrix is accepting it fine, the problem I believe is that when string-ifying the matrix, the precision is too small (needs to be ~400) and will therefore cut off those small digits even if you multiply the matrix). Need to modify KMatrix code.

view (read too?) KV that doesn't exist gives "Failed on line 1402.....232"

	//Svrcd -f ignores argument, uses default always.

	//Svrcd '-f' syntax is inconsistent.

	//Svrcd does not have filled help page

	//sin(x_ explodes!

	//sin(-.2) gives ERROR: Unidentified variable '-.2'

	//Actually, -.2 in CLC prompt gives unidentified variable!

SAVE_DIR command goes to root dir '/'

When unrecongnized help topic given, says 'ERROR' and doesn't say how to get help topics.

Have not finished updating help system. The pages desperately need to be updated and the topic, function, command list functions need to be implemented.

e^MATRIX gives bad answer

=#### breaks

Matrix size() function

——————— IMPLEMENT ———————

	//- Header manipulation
- Plotting! (In CLC 4.0 or CLC 3.0P)
- Add to help files how to load default variables and what options are
- Matrix element access!
- Factorials!
- scrolling back and up (see: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/132595/)
- Imaginary numbers?
- Update to long double for higher precision
- View without read rcd files?
- 'state' files? Allow to pick up where left off? Autosave state?
- 'tab' to complete file names and directories & variable names?
- let file names contain spaces if surrounded by quotes. Quotes not required for names w/o spaces
- help option
	-v (VERBOSE) verbose (current) output
	-I (INTRO) brief (1 P intro)
	-T (TOPICS) list all topics
	-C (COMMANDS) list all commands
	Allow multiple flags
	-f [fn name(s)] print function help files, if no fn names given will list available function
	[NOFLAG] Command or topic for help

Quick long precision command or runtime long precision change

Save state as you go functionality

Results are printing unacceptable for #####e+### not #####e### || ####e-##

------- ADD VARIABLES ---------

	//Permitivity of free space: 8.85418782 × 10-12 m-3 kg-1 s4 A2
K (e&m) : 8.98755e+09
Conversion vars 
	Angstrom
	eV
	amu
Chem values?
